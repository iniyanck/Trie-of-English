📚 Minimized Lattice Trie (DAWG) Visualizer

This project implements a Minimized Lattice Trie (a form of Directed Acyclic Word Graph - DAWG) in Python to efficiently store a dictionary of words. The resulting graph structure is then exported as JSON for interactive exploration using a D3.js visualization.

The key benefit is that common suffixes are canonicalized and reused across the dictionary, leading to significant memory reduction compared to a standard Trie.

📁 **Project Structure**

The project is organized into three distinct directories:

```
/project_root
├── data_structure/          # Contains the core Python implementation.
│   └── lattice_trie.py
├── visualization/           # Contains the files for the interactive web viewer.
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── script.js
│   └── styles.css
└── datasets/                # Stores the word lists used to build the Trie.
    └── [YOUR_DATASET].csv   # e.g., words.csv, test.csv
```

---

🛠️ **Setup and Requirements**

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Python 3.x
   - Bash

2. **Required Python Library**
   ```
   tqdm (for command-line progress bars)
   ```

3. **Installation**
   ```bash
   pip install tqdm
   ```

4. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Create your word list file (e.g., test.csv) with one word per line.
   - Place this file inside the `datasets/` directory.

5. **Update File Path in Python**
   - You must update the path in `data_structure/lattice_trie.py` to correctly point to your dataset file within the datasets folder.
   - Find the following lines in `data_structure/lattice_trie.py` and ensure the path is correct:

   ```python
   # In data_structure/lattice_trie.py
   # --- The original path helper logic will search for this relative path ---
   words_filepath = os.path.join("datasets", "test.csv") # <-- ENSURE THIS MATCHES YOUR FILENAME
   ```

⚙️ **How to Run**

**Step 1: Generate the Graph Data**

Run the Python script from the root of your project directory:

```bash
python data_structure/lattice_trie.py
```

This script performs the following actions:
- Builds the initial Trie.
- Performs Suffix Canonicalization (minimization).
- Runs a Graph Integrity Check to ensure all paths are valid.
- Generates the graph structure and saves it as `lattice_trie_graph.json` in the root directory of the project.
- You will see output indicating the number of nodes discarded and the success of the integrity check.

**Step 2: Launch the Visualization**

To view the interactive graph, you must serve the `visualization/index.html` file using a local web server (due to browser security restrictions on loading local files).

**Option A: Simple Python HTTP Server (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /path/to/project_root
python -m http.server 8000
```
Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000/visualization/index.html

**Option B: VS Code Live Server**
If you use VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension. Right-click on `visualization/index.html` and select "Open with Live Server."

💡 **Key Visualization Interactions**

Once the graph is loaded, you can:

- **Pan and Zoom** to navigate the graph.
- **Click a Node**: This will freeze the force simulation, dim the irrelevant parts of the graph, and highlight all ancestor paths (prefixes) and descendant paths (suffixes) that pass through the selected node.
- **Generate Words**: Click the "Generate Words" button in the top-right panel to list all valid words formed by combining the highlighted prefixes and suffixes.
- **Unfreeze**: Click the selected node again or click the background to return to the dynamic layout.
- **Theme Toggle**: Use the icon in the top-left to switch between Light and Dark modes.
